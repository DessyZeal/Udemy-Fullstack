    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I love what i do If i tell my story When no one is willing to hear Who takes the glory?
        And who holds it dear? For my story is my mind, Yet to the world i'm a ghost.
        A book the librarian forgot to find.
        A writer who can't write when she needs to the most.
        Writing is a lot like talking But simply not aloud, Or walking Away from the crowd. My story is mine I write it day and night,
        Line by line From morning to midnight. For it is my story I write it every second, minute, and hour. A record of my memories
        Both sweet and sour.

        my past lodges in my marrow and if I wanted a transplant Thered be no match
        Others sorrows dwarf my petty traumas still
        these bones are mine when they creak when they moan when they whine
        theres only one thing I can claim these bones are mine I tell you they are mine and kid to 
        abandon no thing that makes this pulse

    <h1>Leave Me Alone</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Children, ye have not lived, to you it seems Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams,Or carnival of careless joys that leap
        About your hearts like billows on the deep In flames of amber and of amethyst.
        Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist
        Till some resistless hour shall rise and move Your hearts to wake and hunger after love,
        And thirst with passionate longing for the things That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings. 
        Till ye have battled with great grief and fears, And borne the conflict of dream-shattering years,
        Wounded with fierce desire and worn with strife, Children, ye have not lived: for this is life.
    </p>
