        <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
        In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
        chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, 
        chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, 
        chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original 
        English cock,
        and is widely used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.</p>
        <h3>Biology and habitat</h3>
        <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny, 
        pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs
        (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).</p>
