    <p>For the culinary use of <b>chickens</b>, see Chicken as food. For other uses,

    <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
        In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources,
        and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
        chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).<sup>[20]</sup> In fact,
        chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still
        often in trade and scientific contexts,
        chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original
        English cock,
        and is widely used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.</p>
    <h3>Biology and habitat</h3>
    <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours
        than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has
        only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the
        comb, or eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs
        (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).</p>
        <h2>A Poem</h2>
        <p>Bishops much loved and much discussed ode to loss, which Claudia Roth Pierpont called 
            “a triumph of control, understatement, wit. <br>Even of self-mockery, in the poetically pushed rhyme word “vaster,”<br> 
            and the ladylike, pinkies-up “shant.” An exceedingly rare mention of her mother—as a woman who once owned a watch.
            A continent standing in for losses larger than itself.”</p>

        Salamanders are a group of amphibians with a lizard-like appearance, including short legs and a tail in both larval
        and adult forms.

        Several species of salamander inhabit the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest, including the Ensatina, the
        Northwestern Salamander and the Rough-skinned Newt. Most salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms.
